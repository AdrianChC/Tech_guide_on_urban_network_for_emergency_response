# Tech_guide_on_urban_network_for_emergency_response
The objective of this guide is to identify the most useful road network in a specific loca-tion to get to the main services around in case of emergency. This guide could be used in slums or other areas, regardless of size. However, areas at the scale of cities or even wards requires heavier computational analysis and a more complex process of decision making that is not covered in this guide.
